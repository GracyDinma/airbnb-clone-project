# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Project is a real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform.
It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems,database design, API development and appliation security.

Project Goals
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication,and profile management.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Team Roles

Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

DATABASE DESIGN
1. Users: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
2. Properties: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
3. Bookings: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
4. Reviews: Post and manage reviews for properties.
5. Payments: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

FEATURE BREAKDOWN
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

API SECURITY
1. Authentication: Verifies the identity of users or systems accessing the API.
Implementation: Use token-based authentication like JSON Web Token, OAuth 2.0, or API keys.

2. Authorization: Determines what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform.
Implementation: Role-Based Access Control or Attribute Based Access Control.
3. Rate Limiting: Limits the number of requests a user can make in a given time.
Implementation: Use API gateways or middleware to enforce limits.

CI/CD PIPELINE
CI/CD is a set of practices and tools that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to produce.

CI/CD is important for the project.
1. Faster Development Cycles.
2. Improved code quality.
3. Consistency and Reliability.

Tools for CI/CD
GitHub Actions, Docker, Jenkins
